⚡ Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Auth window doesn’t open	Ensure your OAuth client type is Desktop. Try deleting token.pickle and reauthorizing.
403 / Insufficient permissions	Recreate credentials with drive.readonly scope enabled.
Excel read error	Make sure your file is .xlsx and has columns filename and company.
No results found	Check Drive sharing permissions and verify filenames (case-sensitive).
Download fails	Ensure the target folder is writable and not locked by another process.
